# Unique Iris Detection and Authentication Project

This project leverages advanced image processing, machine learning, and biometric techniques to detect and authenticate unique iris patterns using multiple spectra such as visible and near-infrared light. The system is designed for scalable, real-world applications in high-security environments.

## Key Features:
- **Iris Preprocessing:** Advanced normalization, resizing, and noise reduction techniques to standardize iris images.
- **Deep Learning (CNN):** Convolutional Neural Networks for feature extraction and classification of iris patterns.
- **Polarization and Spectral Analysis:** Utilization of polarization properties and multi-spectral imaging for enhanced iris pattern recognition.
- **Authentication Methods:** Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Hamming distance for precise iris authentication.

## Project Structure:
- `src/`: Contains the core logic for iris preprocessing, detection, and authentication.
- `models/`: Pre-trained CNN models used for iris pattern recognition.
- `data/`: Raw and processed iris image datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for data preprocessing, detection, and authentication experiments.
- `tests/`: Unit tests to ensure the reliability of preprocessing, detection, and authentication methods.
- `docs/`: Documentation outlining the protocol, CNN architecture, and authentication methods.
- `reports/`: Contains performance reports and visualizations generated from the system.
