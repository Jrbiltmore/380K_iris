# CNN Model Architecture for Iris Detection

This document outlines the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture used for detecting and classifying unique iris patterns. The model is designed to extract spatial hierarchies of features from iris images and classify them for biometric authentication.

## 1. Model Overview

The CNN model used for iris detection consists of the following layers:
- **Input Layer**: Accepts an RGB iris image of size (128, 128, 3).
- **Convolutional Layers**: Three convolutional layers with ReLU activation functions are used to extract features.
- **Max-Pooling Layers**: Each convolutional layer is followed by a max-pooling layer to reduce the spatial dimensions.
- **Fully Connected Layer**: The output of the convolutional layers is flattened and passed through a fully connected layer with ReLU activation.
- **Dropout Layer**: A dropout layer is added to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the input units to zero.
- **Output Layer**: The final fully connected layer uses a softmax activation function to classify the iris image into one of the classes.

### Model Summary:
- **Input Shape**: (128, 128, 3)

## 3. Model Diagram

The diagram below illustrates the architecture of the CNN model used for iris detection. The image is passed through several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling and is ultimately classified using fully connected layers.

```plaintext
Input (128x128x3) --> Conv2D (32 filters) --> MaxPooling (2x2) --> Conv2D (64 filters) --> MaxPooling (2x2) 
--> Conv2D (128 filters) --> MaxPooling (2x2) --> Flatten --> Dense (128 units) --> Dropout (0.5) --> Output (2 units)
```

## 4. Model Training

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with categorical crossentropy as the loss function. The training process involves feeding the network with batches of labeled iris images and adjusting the weights based on the classification error.

- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Epochs**: 50 (can be fine-tuned based on the dataset size)
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy

### Code Example:
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

def build_cnn(input_shape=(128, 128, 3), num_classes=2):
    model = Sequential([
        Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
        Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
        Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
        Flatten(),
        Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        Dropout(0.5),
        Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model
```

## 5. Model Evaluation

After training the CNN model, it is evaluated on a test set to measure its accuracy in detecting unique iris patterns. The key performance metrics include:

- **Accuracy**: Measures how often the model correctly classifies iris images.
- **Loss**: Measures the prediction error over the test set.
- **Precision**: Measures the percentage of true positives among all predicted positives.
- **Recall**: Measures the percentage of true positives among all actual positives.

### Code Example for Model Evaluation:
```python
# Evaluate the model on test data
results = model.evaluate(test_generator)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {results[1]:.4f}")
print(f"Test Loss: {results[0]:.4f}")
```

## Conclusion

The CNN architecture described in this document is optimized for detecting and classifying unique iris patterns. By combining convolutional layers, max-pooling, and fully connected layers, the model achieves high accuracy in biometric authentication. The use of dropout and ReLU activations helps improve generalization and prevent overfitting, making the model suitable for real-world deployment in iris recognition systems.
